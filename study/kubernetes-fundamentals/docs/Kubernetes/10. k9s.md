## 📱 Practical Workflows

### 1. Pod Troubleshooting
```bash
:pods           # View all pods
Shift+S         # Sort by status
/error          # Filter for error states
Enter           # Describe problematic pod
l               # View logs
s               # Shell into container if needed
```

### 2. Deployment Management
```bash
:deploy         # View deployments
/myapp          # Filter for specific app
Enter           # Describe deployment
y               # View YAML
e               # Edit if needed
```

### 3. Resource Monitoring
```bash
:pods           # Start with pods
Shift+A         # Sort by age (newest first)
j/k             # Navigate through pods
Enter           # Describe selected pod
l               # Check logs
```

### 4. Storage Investigation

## 🚀 Pro Tips

### Efficiency Tips
- **Use search liberally** - `/` is your friend for finding resources quickly
- **Learn the shortcuts** - `:deploy`, `:pods`, etc. are faster than navigating menus
- **Sort strategically** - `Shift+S` for status helps identify issues quickly
- **Use describe first** - `Enter` gives you detailed info before taking actions

### Troubleshooting Workflow
```bash
1. :pods          # Start with pods overview
2. Shift+S        # Sort by status to see issues
3. /error         # Filter problematic pods  
4. Enter          # Describe the pod
5. l              # Check logs
6. s              # Shell in if needed
```

### Monitoring Workflow  
```bash
1. :nodes         # Check cluster health
2. :pods          # Monitor pod status
3. Shift+A        # Sort by age to see recent changes
4. :events        # Check cluster events
5. /warning       # Filter for warnings
```

## 📊 Resource Views Comparison

| View | Command | Use Case | Key Actions |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| Pods | `:pods` | Monitor applications | `l` (logs), `s` (shell), `d` (delete) |
| Deployments | `:deploy` | Manage applications | `e` (edit), `y` (yaml), Enter (describe) |
| Services | `:svc` | Network troubleshooting | Enter (describe), `y` (yaml) |
| Ingress | `:ing` | External access | Enter (describe), `e` (edit) |
| PVCs | `:pvc` | Storage issues | Enter (describe), `d` (delete) |
| Events | `:events` | Cluster debugging | `/` (search), Enter (details) |
| Nodes | `:nodes` | Cluster health | Enter (describe), `y` (yaml) |

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Daily Operations
- **Start with cluster overview** - Check nodes, then pods
- **Use sorting effectively** - Sort by status to catch issues early  
- **Regular event checking** - `:events` shows cluster health
- **Namespace awareness** - Use `Ctrl+a` to toggle all namespaces view

### Troubleshooting
- **Follow the data flow** - Ingress → Service → Pod → Container
- **Check events first** - Often reveals the root cause
- **Use logs extensively** - `l` command is invaluable
- **Describe before acting** - `Enter` gives context before changes

### Performance
- **Filter aggressively** - Use `/` to reduce noise
- **Learn keyboard shortcuts** - Much faster than mouse navigation
- **Use resource-specific views** - More efficient than generic browsing
- **Bookmark common workflows** - Develop muscle memory for frequent tasks
